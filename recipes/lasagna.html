    <h3>Classic Lasagna</h3>

    <p>
        This classic lasagna recipe is a comforting Italian dish that's perfect for 
        family gatherings. Layers of rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta cheese, and tender 
        pasta sheets are baked to perfection, creating a hearty and satisfying meal.
        
        Each slice reveals layers of flavor and texture — tangy tomato, savory meat,
        and gooey melted cheese — making lasagna a great make-ahead dish that actually
        tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld.
